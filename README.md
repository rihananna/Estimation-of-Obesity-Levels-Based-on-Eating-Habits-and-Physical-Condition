#@ Obesity Level Prediction Model
This project is a machine learning application that predicts an individual's obesity level based on various lifestyle and health characteristics. Using a dataset with demographic and health information, we developed, evaluated, and deployed machine learning models to classify obesity levels.

## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict obesity levels, using key features such as age, weight, height, exercise habits, eating habits, and family health history. By analyzing these features, the model can classify an individual's obesity level, which is valuable for health awareness and early prevention.
